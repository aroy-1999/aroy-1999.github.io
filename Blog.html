    <h2>100 Geese do NOT Land on Dock</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">August 17, 2025</p>
    <p> Almost 100 geese wanted nothing to do with Riverside Boat Club's dock. They have learned that they can not
        outsmart the Smart Goose Deterrent System.

    <h2>Ways to Keep Dogs From Pooping in Your Yard</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">August 9, 2025</p>
    <p> The other day, my friend was walking his dogs by a perfectly manicured lawn. It had one of those signs with a
        dog squatting. It said "no poop please". He called me and said, “You should tweak the Smart Goose Deterrent
        System to
        spray dogs that poop and pee on people’s front yard". I told him I was already kinda doing that.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was a stray dog that used to do his business in my backyard. I tweaked the configuration on my SGDS QA
        environment to consider dogs as unfriendly animals and let the system do its thing. It was funny watching video
        of that stray dog getting sprayed the first time. He did not know what hit him. He looked over his shoulder and
        gave the sprinkler a WTF look. Then the sprinkler came back around and hit him again. It’s been eight
        weeks since that dog visited.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a dog owner. Dogs pooping in a neighbors yard is an owner problem not a dog problem. Owners should not let
        their dogs out unattended or unleashed. Owners should clean up after their dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think the thing to do if SGDS finds a dog pooping in your yard is to make sure sprinklers are aimed outward
        and hit the owners.
    </p>
    <p>
        FYI, my QA environment watches for deer around my garden too.

    <h2>Migratory Bird Treaty Act - Goose Harassment</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">July 23, 2025</p>
    <p>I am not a goose hater, I just don’t like it when they poop on my rowing club’s dock. </p>


    <p>The other day I texted an attaboy to another member of my club when he shooed away geese from the corner of our
        dock. I jokingly wrote to him, don’t worry, “harassing” geese is not in violation of the Migratory Bird Treaty
        Act. This spurred an interesting conversation between me and another member of my club. They said “harassment”
        is a violation of the MBTA. We started dueling each other with Google searches, each finding results that
        supported our position. Some findings mentioned “harassing” birds as a violation of the law and others did not.
        This confused me. In the end I went to the <a
                href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/chapter-7/subchapter-II"
                target="_blank">Cornell Law School website</a> and read the original MBTA statute. Then I examined the
        changes to the statute over the years. No mention of “harassing” as a violation. Finally, I noticed that
        some of our search results were for the MBTA and others were for the Endangered Species Act. The MBTA does not
        include "harassing" as a violation, the ESA does. Bingo!
    <p>

    <p>The Canada Goose was considered an endangered species at one time, but <a
            href="https://www.fws.gov/story/2000-07/aleutian-canada-goose#:~:text=Although%20the%20goose%20would%20no%20longer%20be,success%20story%20for%20all%20Americans%2C%22%20said%20Allen."
            target="blank">removed from the list in 2001.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Interesting (or maybe not) in June 2024 the Chevron Doctrine was overturned. This took away the ability for
        government agencies, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to interpret the “their own” laws and put it in
        the hands of the courts. As recently as
        May 2025, the <a href="https://maineaudubon.org/news/esa_harm_definition/" target="blank">courts were
            arguing</a> the meaning of the key words “harm” and “take” in the Endangered Species Act.
        “Take” includes “harass” in the ESA definition. This whole thing gets messier than a dock visited by a
        flock (or should that be a gaggle, skein, wedge, or team) of geese.
    </p>
    <p>I am not a goose hater, nor am I a lawyer. I will likely never dig so deeply into the Migratory Bird Treaty Act
        again. I definitely consider yelling at geese or spraying them with water as “harassment” and fair game.
        Hopefully
        I will not end up behind bars for creating a system that uses AI to spray geese. My “take” is,
        if we do not want geese in “our” space, we need to outsmart them, not harm them.

    <h2>New Cameras are Great</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">May 2025</p>
    <p>SGDS has been online at the <a href="https://www.riversideboatclub.com/" target="_blank">Riverside Boat Club</a>
        for several weeks this year (their second season with SGDS). The new cameras are performing better than
        expected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sharper images: SGDS captures geese before they even step onto the dock.
        </li>
        <li>clearer night vision: A higher percentage of geese are found in the dark.</li>
        <li>wider field of view: With two cameras, RBC can now cover their entire dock, all 170 feet, with a little
            extra to spare.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System Improvements</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">Jan 2025</p>
    <p>We've spent the winter making improvements to SGDS. We are getting closer to a shrink-wrapped product.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>using off-the-shelf security cameras</li>
        <li>using off-the-shelf smart valve controllers</li>
        <li>improved remote hardware support</li>
        <li>explored other AI and image recognition tools</li>
        <li>added advanced filters to eliminate problematic regions</li>

    <h2>2024 Year in Review</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">November 2024</p>
    <p>Now that the rowing season is coming to an end, let's reflect back on the progress we made with the Smart
        Goose
        Deterrent System in 2024. </p>
    <p>We appreciate working with the <a href="https://www.riversideboatclub.com/" target="_blank">Riverside
        Boat
        Club</a> in Cambridge, MA. They provided an ideal environment for testing: lots of geese, rowers,
        cooperation,
        and feedback.</p>
    <p>SGDS started as an idea in February, and quickly evolved into a system that worked remarkably well.</p>
    <p><img class="myimg" alt="timeline of SGDS milestones" src="images/timeline.png"
            title="timeline of SGDS milestones" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>All along the way, we examined every frame of data collected by SGDS, to make sure it was behaving as
        desired. We
        found out that we needed to teach the AI how to deal with some interesting situations:</p>
    <i>
        <ul>
            <li>penguins do not live in Boston</li>
            <li>great blue herons are our friends</li>
            <li>light reflections off the water are not flocks of small birds</li>
            <li>spiders crawling over the camera lens need to be dealt with</li>
        </ul>
    </i>
    <p>We learned that geese are very persistent. They constantly tested the boundaries of the SGDS sprinklers.
        They learned exactly where they could hang out and be safe. On some mornings, you could see what looked like
        a hundred geese swimming by the dock, just out of range of sprinklers.</p>
    <p>We examined data from the 2nd half of the season. Geese visited at all hours of the day, mostly when
        people were
        not on the dock. Most RBC rowers launch in the morning and evening so we disabled sprinklers in those
        windows. </p>
    <p><img class="myimg" alt="SGDS visits by hour" src="images/visitsByHour.png" title="SGDS visits by hour"
            loading="lazy"/></p>

    <p>In the 2nd half of the season, SGDS found geese over 1400 times (77 times on the busiest day).</p>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img class="myimg" alt="SGDS visits by date" src="images/visitsByDate.png" title="SGDS visits by date"
            loading="lazy"/></p>
    <p> If you believe a goose produces 1 pound of poop per day, hangs out for 4 hours when it visits the dock,
        and travels in groups of 4 or more: we estimate that we kept 2000 pounds of poop off the dock! </p>
    <p>On these cold November mornings, SGDS is shut down. Sadly, the geese are back, and they are making a mess
        of RBC's dock. The cold weather rowers have had to learn to sweep poop again (and they might not be as
        quick to learn as the geese). We are happy knowing SGDS made a difference for RBC this season and look
        forward
        to doing battle again next year.
