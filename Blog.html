    <h2>New Cameras are Great</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">May 2025</p>
    <p>SGDS has been online at the <a href="https://www.riversideboatclub.com/" target="_blank">Riverside Boat Club</a>
        for several weeks (RBC's second season with SGDS).  We like the new cameras:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>sharper images: SGDS captures geese before they
            even step onto the dock.
        </li>
        <li>clearer night vision: Bad news for geese.</li>
        <li>wider field of view: With two zones, RBC can now cover their entire dock, all 170 feet, with a little extra
            to spare.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nereid Boat Club</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">May 2025</p>
    <p>We are working with the <a href="http://nereidbc.org/" target="_blank">Nereid Boat Club</a> in Rutherford, NJ to
        install SGDS on their dock. </p>

    <h2>System Improvements</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">Jan 2025</p>
    <p>We've spent the winter making improvements to SGDS. We are getting closer to a shrink-wrapped product.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>using off-the-shelf security cameras</li>
        <li>using off-the-shelf smart valve controllers</li>
        <li>improved remote hardware support</li>
        <li>explored other AI and image recognition tools</li>
        <li>added advanced filters to eliminate problematic regions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2024 Year in Review</h2>
    <p class="subTitle">November 2024</p>
    <p>Now that the rowing season is coming to an end, let's reflect back on the progress we made with the Smart
        Goose
        Deterrent System in 2024. </p>
    <p>We appreciate working with the <a href="https://www.riversideboatclub.com/" target="_blank">Riverside
        Boat
        Club</a> in Cambridge, MA. They provided an ideal environment for testing: lots of geese, rowers,
        cooperation,
        and feedback.</p>
    <p>SGDS started as an idea in February, and quickly evolved into a system that worked remarkably well.</p>
    <p><img class="myimg" alt="timeline of SGDS milestones" src="images/timeline.png"
            title="timeline of SGDS milestones"></p>
    <p>All along the way, we examined every frame of data collected by SGDS, to make sure it was behaving as
        desired. We
        found out that we needed to teach the AI how to deal with some interesting situations:</p>
    <i>
        <ul>
            <li>penguins do not live in Boston</li>
            <li>great blue herons are our friends</li>
            <li>light reflections off the water are not flocks of small birds</li>
            <li>spiders crawling over the camera lens need to be dealt with</li>
        </ul>
    </i>
    <p>We learned that geese are very persistent. They constantly tested the boundaries of the SGDS sprinklers.
        They
        learned exactly where they could hang out and be safe. On some mornings, you could see what looked like
        a
        hundred geese swimming by the dock, just out of range of sprinklers.</p>
    <p>We tallied data from the 2nd half of the season. Geese visited at all hours of the day, mostly when
        people were
        not on the dock. Most RBC rowers launch in the morning and evening so we disabled sprinklers in those
        windows. </p>
    <p><img class="myimg" alt="SGDS visits by hour" src="images/visitsByHour.png" title="SGDS visits by hour"
            loading="lazy"/></p>

    <p>In the 2nd half of the season, SGDS found geese over 1400 times (77 times on the busiest day).</p>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img class="myimg" alt="SGDS visits by date" src="images/visitsByDate.png" title="SGDS visits by date"
            loading="lazy"/></p>
    <p> If you believe a goose produces 1 pound of poop per day, hangs out for 4 hours when it visits the dock,
        and travels in groups of 4 or more: we estimate that we kept 2000 pounds of poop off the dock! </p>
    <p>On these cold November mornings, SGDS is shut down. Sadly, the geese are back, and they are making a mess
        of RBC's dock. The cold weather rowers have had to learn to sweep poop again (and they might not be as
        quick to learn as the geese). We are happy knowing SGDS made a difference for RBC this season and look
        forward
        to doing battle again next year.
