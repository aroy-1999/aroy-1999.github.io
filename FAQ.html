    <button class="collapsible">How often do geese poop?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sources are all over the place on this. Some say as often as every 12 minutes. Some say as much as 2
            pounds a day. Others suggest these numbers are inflated. One thing for sure, geese poop too often
            and too much. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">When do geese visit?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Geese are creatures of habit. They return to the same nesting and feeding grounds year after year.
            They generally arrive in the Spring and leave in the Fall.</p>
        <p>Geese visit at all hours of the day. They typically visit when people are not
            around. Once roosted they do not leave unless encouraged.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Will geese come back?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Geese are persistent. When confronted with a deterrent, they continue to
            probe until they find the deterrent's weakness. Then they come back.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Are geese really protected?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) is a United States federal law, first enacted in 1918, to
            implement a convention for the protection of migratory birds between the United States and Canada.
            The MBTA prohibits the take (including killing, capturing, selling, trading, and transport) of protected
            migratory bird species without prior authorization. Geese must NOT be harmed (but they can be
            harassed.)</p>
    </div>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Are sprinklers effective?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Geese do NOT like to be sprayed with sprinklers. It's kind of strange given they spend a good amount of time
            swimming.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>


    <button class="collapsible">Are sprinklers humane?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sprinklers are often a recommended deterrent by state and local authorities. They are considered a
            method of "harassment". Sprinklers are far better than other methods of harassment: loud noises,
            flashing lights, "tube man", ... Neighbors appreciate that you are NOT using the other methods.</p>

    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>

    <button class="collapsible">What about my dogs?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>SGDS treats certain animals as "friendlies". Dogs are on the list.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="whitespace">&nbsp;</p>

    <button class="collapsible">How good are image recognition and AI?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Image recognition and AI are only as good as the images you feed them for identification and training.
            Unfortunately one cannot always guarantee clear images.  Lighting may be poor, the background may not provide enough
            contrast, there may be things in the way, ... Frankly, even the human eye has difficulty in some of these
            conditions. SGDS uses additional logic to help avoid problems, but it is still not perfect. </p>
